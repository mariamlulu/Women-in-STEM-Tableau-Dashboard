# 👩‍🔬 Women in STEM: Global Education Trends (2000–2023)

### 🌍 Overview  
This Tableau project visualizes **two decades of global trends in women’s participation in STEM education** (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) across six major countries — *Australia, Canada, China, Germany, India,* and *the USA*.  

The analysis focuses on **female enrollment rates, graduation outcomes, and gender parity (0–1 Gender Gap Index)** to reveal where equality has progressed — and where disparities remain.

## 📈 Analytical Goals
- Examine **country-level progress** in gender parity across 24 years.  
- Compare **STEM disciplines** (Engineering, Computer Science, Biology, Mathematics).  
- Measure correlation between **enrollment and graduation** to identify retention gaps.  
- Track **Gender Gap Index trends** to assess parity progress toward 1.0.

## 🧠 Key Insights

### 🌎 Global View  
- Average female STEM **enrollment = 43.9%**  
- Average female **graduation = 36.7%**  
- **Global Gender Gap Index = 0.74**, showing gradual progress but not yet equality.  

### 🎓 Country-Level Trends  
- 🇦🇺 **Australia** and 🇨🇦 **Canada** lead in gender parity (Gap Index > 0.9).  
- 🇮🇳 **India** and 🇨🇳 **China** show rapid growth post-2010 due to national STEM initiatives.  
- 🇩🇪 **Germany** remains stable but low in female enrollment, particularly in engineering.  

### ⚙️ Field-Level Insights  
- **Biology** and **Mathematics** have the highest female representation.  
- **Engineering** and **Computer Science** remain the least gender-balanced.  
- The retention gap from enrollment to graduation highlights persistent structural barriers.  

### 📊 Correlation Highlights  
- Strong positive relationship between **enrollment and graduation** — early access predicts success.  
- However, **Engineering** shows weaker correlation, reflecting higher dropout rates among women.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- 🌏 Gender parity in STEM is improving, but **discipline-specific inequality persists**.  
- 🎓 **Graduation rates lag behind enrollment**, indicating retention challenges.  
- ⚙️ Emerging economies are catching up rapidly, while developed nations face cultural barriers in tech and engineering.  
- 💬 Sustainable equality requires policies beyond access — focused on retention, mentorship, and institutional culture.

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Add **time-series forecasting** to project parity trends to 2030.  
- Build **interactive parameter filters** for field and region selection.  
- Develop a **Power BI version** for cross-platform analytics comparison.
